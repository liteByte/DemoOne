# Welcome to Demo One

This demo is intended to showcase liteByte's frontend abilities with a simple 
backoffice system integrated with Google Maps (because why not).

Feel free to look through the code, download it or check out the [live demo](litebyte-demo-one.herokuapp.com).


### Run it locally

If you wish to clone it and run it locally, be sure to follow these steps:

```
npm install

npm start
```

Quite simple really.
